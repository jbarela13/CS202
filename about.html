    <h2>About Me.</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Jasmine Barela, I am a student athlete at Carroll College pursuing a degree in Business Management with a minor in Social Media Management and Public Relations. Balancing academics and athletics has taught me discipline, leadership, and hard work both on and off the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey to Carroll hasn’t been the easiest. I’ve undergone two ACL surgeries, each testing my patience, focus, and determination. Those challenges didn’t stop me they fueled me. I grew stronger, worked harder, and strived to become the best version of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about combining my love for sports and business. My goal is to build a career where I can collaborate with athletes, teams, and brands to tell their stories, inspire others, and make an impact on the next generation.
